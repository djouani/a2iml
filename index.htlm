<h1>Hello World</h1>


<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.

The proposed chair aims to develop research and innovation activities concerning theoretical and technological aspects of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). 
The chair research activities propose to focus on extending actual Machine Learning (ML) frameworks for and/or Logical based Decision systems, to consider the geometrical and 
topological aspects of the data and associated ML models with the objective to overcome the limitations and drawbacks of existing machine learning techniques. Moreover, the chair 
proposes to work also on the design of Open Unified Cloud Platform for AI/ML based systems. 
The expected innovations of chair will be twofold. First, the chair will contribute to software AI-cloud architecture design by defining and aggregating the main generic components 
for AI/ML based projects and providing the automation mechanism. Secondly, the chair will contribute on theoretical level by providing optimisation framework and geometric and 
topological tools for the different steps of a ML project. The objective is to build a unified approach for industrial generative AI support. 
The technical expected innovations are shown in Figure 1. The chair will provide a core managing a big dependable system that involves cloud access, device control, decision support 
and virtual workspaces. Important technical achievements are expected with low latency analytics and long-term analytics. 
The chair will consider applications user-case from the TUT AI-Hub and that range from healthcare to cognitive co-robots with interaction with humans.
